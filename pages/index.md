title: San Francisco 311 Cases
---

<!-- SECTION 1: BUILD A BASIC SUMMARY PAGE -->

<!-- 1. Add your first query
    - Name it 'description'
    - Calculate min_date, max_date, and case count from the sf311.cases table
-->

```sql description
select min(opened) as min_date, max(opened) as max_date, count(*) as count
from sf311.cases
```

<!-- 2. Add a Details component to explain the dataset
    - Use the Value component to display the min date, max date, and record count in the Details componet
    - Add a nested Details component inside to display this explanation of 311 cases:
          311 is the city's request service for non-emergencies. Citizens can report local issues to 311 and monitor the status of the request. Each case represents something that was reported through this service.
--> 

<Details title='About this data'>
  This dataset includes <Value data={description} column=count fmt=num0k/> 311 cases in San Francisco from <Value data={description} column=min_date fmt=shortdate/> to <Value data={description} column=max_date fmt=shortdate/>.

  <Details title='What are 311 Cases?'>
    311 is the city's request service for non-emergencies. Citizens can report local issues to 311 and monitor the status of the request. Each case represents something that was reported through this service.
  </Details>

</Details>


<!-- 3. Add summary BigValues
    - Add a query called 'summary' to get total_cases and open_cases (where status='Open')
    - Add a BigValue for each of those metrics
-->


```sql summary
select count(*) as total_cases, count(*) filter (status = 'Open') as open_cases
from sf311.cases
```

<BigValue
  data={summary}
  value=total_cases
  fmt=num0k
/>

<BigValue
  data={summary}
  value=open_cases
  fmt=num0k
/>


<!-- 4. Add a trend line chart
    - Add a query called 'trend' which includes date and case count
    - Use the opened column for the date. Since this is a timestamp you will need to use date_trunc()
-->

```sql trend
select date_trunc('day', opened) as date,
count(*) as cases
from sf311.cases
where ${inputs.dimensions}
group by all
order by date asc
```

<LineChart
  title="Case Trend"
  data={trend}
  x=date
  y=cases
  yAxisTitle=cases
/>

<!-- 5. Add a DimensionGrid 
  - Create a query called 'cases' which pulls these columns:
      - responsible_agency
      - category
      - request_type
      - source
  - Add a DimensionGrid component which uses that data
-->

```sql cases
select 
  responsible_agency,
  category,
  request_type,
  source
from sf311.cases 
```

<DimensionGrid data={cases} name=dimensions/>

<!-- 7. Add a CalendarHeatmap which uses your 'trend' query -->

 <CalendarHeatmap
  title="Daily 311 Cases"
  data={trend}
  date=date
  value=cases
/>

<!-- END OF SECTION 1 -->



<!-- SECTION 2: BUILD A SIMPLE CATEGORIES PAGE -->

<!-- 1. Add a new page called categories.md -->

<!-- 2. Copy and paste these instructions onto that page -->

<!-- 3. Add a query that pulls the category, request_type, and case count -->

<!-- 4. Add a DataTable component that includes conditional formatting for the case count column (see https://docs.evidence.dev/components/data-table/#conditional-formatting) -->

<!-- 5. Add search to the table -->

<!-- END OF SECTION 2 -->


<!-- SECTION 3: ADD INTERACTIVITY TO YOUR SUMMARY PAGE (INDEX.MD) -->

<!-- 1. Change your dimension grid to become an input by using the 'name' prop - call it 'dimensions' -->

<!-- 2. Then hook this up to the LineChart by adding a 'where' clause to your trend query. See docs here: https://docs.evidence.dev/components/dimension-grid/#as-an-input -->

<!-- 3. Add the input to the chart title so you get the context when the chart updates. Inputs can be referenced in curly braces like: {inputs.my_input} -->

<!-- END OF SECTION 3 -->


<!-- SECTION 4: BUILD A NEIGHBORHOOD EXPLORER PAGE -->

<!-- 1. Add a folder called neighborhoods in your pages directory. Then add a file called index.md in that folder -->

<!-- 2. Copy and paste these instructions onto that page -->

 <!-- 3. Add a page title -->


<!-- 4. Build a neighborhood map and make it an interactive input
        - Start with a SQL query that gets neighborhood and case count - call the query 'neighborhoods'
        - Add an AreaMap component pulling from that data
        - Make the map an input using the 'name' prop - give it a name of 'map_input'
-->

<!-- 5. Set up a page title that changes to show the selected neighborhood name
      - When not selected, the input will default to true
      - You will need to use an if block (https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/if-else/)
      - Title should say "All Neighborhoods" when no neighborhood is selected
-->

<!-- 6. Set up a query to get the case trend for the selected neighborhood. 
        - Name the query 'filtered_trend'
        - Get the week and case count for that specific neighborhood using a where clause
        - See here for an example: https://docs.evidence.dev/components/area-map/#use-map-as-input
        - Note that you will need to handle the situation where no neighborhood is selected (the input will return true in that case)
-->

<!-- 7. Add a LineChart to display the trend data from filtered_trend -->

<!-- 8. Put your AreaMap and LineChart into a Grid with 2 columns
        - You can also give each a title by adding a header above them (e.g., put '### Neighborhood Selector' above the AreaMap)
            - To avoid creating new Grid cells when appending content to a cell, you can use the Group component (https://docs.evidence.dev/components/grid/#group-component)
-->

<!-- 9. Add a category breakdown
        - Create a query called category_breakdown which pulls the category and case count, filtered for the selected neighborhoood
        - Add a DataTable to display the results and use conditional formatting for the case count column
-->

<!-- END OF SECTION 4 -->


<!-- SECTION 5: CREATE NEIGHBORHOOD TEMPLATED PAGE -->

<!-- 1. Create links Evidence will use to auto-generate your templated pages when deploying
    - In pages/neighborhoods/index.md, add a DataTable to the bottom of the page pulling from the 'neighborhoods' query
    - Use the 'link' prop in DataTable to set the link to the 'neighborhood' column
    - This will make each row in the table clickable and will tell Evidence to generate a page for that neighborhood when building your project for deployment
-->

<!-- 2. Create a new file called [neighborhood].md inside your neighborhoods folder -->

<!-- 3. Copy and paste these directions onto that page -->

 <!-- 4. Add a title for the neighborhood using the "page param" (see here: https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/templated-pages/) -->

<!-- 5. Go back to your neighborhood explorer page and test by clicking a row in your DataTable you created in step 1. You should navigate to a neighborhood page and see the title you just added with the neighborhood name -->

<!-- 6. Add a summary BigValue 
        - Add a query called summary which pulls the case count and close rate (cases where status=closed / total cases)
        - Add a BigValue component to display the count and close rate (use the comparison for the close rate - https://docs.evidence.dev/components/big-value/#comparisons)
-->
 
 <!-- 7. Get the last 100 cases in that neighborhood
        - Call this query 'last_100'
        - Filter for the neighborhood using the page param in your query
-->

<!-- 8. Add a PointMap to display the last 100 cases using the latitude and longitude columns 
    - See if you can use the url column in the tooltip to create a link to the SF city site
    - Docs: https://docs.evidence.dev/components/point-map/#with-clickable-link-and-tooltiptypeclick
-->

<!-- 9. Pull the top 10 categories for the neighborhood 
        - Create a query called top_categories
        - Display the results in a horizontal BarChart (use swapXY=true)
-->

<!-- 10. Create a 2-column Grid and put your PointMap and BarChart inside it
        - Adjust the BarChart height using chartAreaHeight to get it to line up well with the PointMap
-->

<!-- 11. Create a dynamic link in your neighborhood explorer by adding this to the bottom of your page title:
    -  [See neighborhood deep dive &rarr;](./{inputs.map_input.neighborhood})
    - You should now see a deep dive link appear when you click on a neighborhood on the map
-->


<!-- END OF SECTION 5 -->


<!-- SECTION 6: DYNAMIC CONTENT GENERATION - VOLUME SPIKES -->

<!-- 1. Copy and paste these directions into your [neighborhood].md file -->


<!-- 2. Add a query to detect volume spikes in cases over time
    - Call the query 'spike_detection'
    - Use this SQL:
 
 WITH case_counts as (
    select 
        category,
        date_trunc('week', opened) as date,
        count(*) as cases
    from sf311.cases
    where neighborhood = '${params.neighborhood}'
    group by all
),

category_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        category,
        date,
        cases,
        AVG(cases) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 30 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg,
        STDDEV(cases) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 30 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_stddev
    FROM 
        case_counts
)

SELECT 
    category,
    date,
    cases,
    rolling_avg,
    rolling_stddev,
    (cases - rolling_avg) / rolling_stddev as stddev,
    CASE 
        WHEN cases > (rolling_avg + 2 * rolling_stddev) THEN 'Spike'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS status
FROM 
    category_stats

-->

<!-- 3. Add another query called all_spikes to filter for spikes using the status column (status = 'Spike') -->

<!-- 4. Add a section with a title for Volume Spikes in this neighborhood
        - Include a Details component with this definition:
            A volume spike is defined as a weekly case count exceeding 2x the standard deviation of the previous 30 weeks
-->

<!-- 5. Pull the distinct list of categories with spikes in a query called 'categories_with_spikes'
        - Do this by summing the cases from the all_spikes query
        - Use query chaining to accomplish this (https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/queries/#query-chaining)
 -->


<!-- 6. Add an if block to display different content depending on whether spikes are present
        - You can use categories_with_spikes.length in the if block to determine if it has any results
        - For now, just put a simple text message to confirm that there are or aren't any spikes. In the next step we will add the real content
        - For the case where there are no spikes, you can include text like "There are no spikes above 2 standard deviations from the 30 week rolling average"
-->

<!-- 7. Include a loop of line charts to display spikes
        - In the part of the if block where spikes are present, add a Grid with 3 columns
        - Inside the Grid, add a loop using an #each block (https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/loops/)
        - The each block should use the categories_with_spikes query
        - Add a LineChart inside the loop - use the below for your data prop:
                data={spike_detection.where(`category = '${row.category}'`)}
        - Test your page - you should see multiple charts appearing for neighborhoods that have spikes
-->

<!-- 8. Add annotations to show spikes on the line charts
        - Inside the LineChart in your loop, add a ReferencePoint component (https://docs.evidence.dev/components/annotations/#reference-point)
        - Use this code for the ReferencePoint:
                    <ReferencePoint
                        data={all_spikes.where(`category = '${row.category}'`)}
                        x=date
                        y=cases
                        label=status
                        color=red
                        symbolSize=16
                        symbolBorderWidth=1
                        symbolBorderColor=red
                        symbolOpacity=0.25
                    />
        - Check out your page again to see the spikes circled in red
-->

<!-- 9. That's it! You now have a fully interactive data app running locally. Nice work! -->
